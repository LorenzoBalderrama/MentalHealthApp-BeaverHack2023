# Mental Health App - Created by Lorenzo B and Audrey 

This project is a chatbot implementation using Elizabot.js for the backend and Svelte for the frontend. It provides a conversational interface with a therapy bot that responds to user inputs based on predefined responses. The backend is built using Node.js and the Elizabot.js package, while the frontend is developed with Svelte, HTML, and CSS.

## Backend

The backend of this project is implemented using Node.js and the Elizabot.js package. Elizabot.js is a JavaScript library that simulates the behavior of the original Eliza chatbot, which was developed in the 1960s. It uses a pattern matching and transformation mechanism to generate responses based on user input. The code in the backend captures user input, passes it to the Elizabot instance, and displays the chatbot's response in the console. Customizations have been made to tailor the responses to a therapy bot style.

## Frontend

The frontend of this project is built using Svelte, a modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. Svelte allows for efficient rendering and minimal bundle sizes by compiling the code at build time. The frontend components are structured using Svelte's component-based architecture, which enables reusability and easy management of the UI elements. HTML and CSS files are utilized for creating the layout and styling of the chatbot interface. The frontend interacts with the backend by sending user input and displaying the chatbot's responses in a user-friendly manner.
